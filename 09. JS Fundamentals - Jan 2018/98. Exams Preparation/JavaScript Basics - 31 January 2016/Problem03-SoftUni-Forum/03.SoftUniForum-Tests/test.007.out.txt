Far far away, behind the word mountains,
far from the countries ******* and Consonantia,
there live the <a href="/users/profile/show/blind">blind</a> texts. Separated they <a href="/users/profile/show/live">live</a> in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.
A ***** ***** named <a href="/users/profile/show/Duden">Duden</a> flows by their place and supplies
it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country,
in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.
Even the all-powerful <a href="/users/profile/show/Pointing">Pointing</a> has no control about the blind texts
it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind
text by the name <code> of Lorem Ipsum #decided to </code>
leave for the far World of Grammar.
The Big <a href="/users/profile/show/Oxmox">Oxmox</a> advised her
not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas,
wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli,
but the Little Blind Text didn't listen.
